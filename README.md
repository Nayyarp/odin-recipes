# odin-recipes

Welcome to my first ever project for The Odin Project! On this day, 20 Sept 2022, I will start production for the "Recipes" HTML project.

By the end of this project, I would ideally have liked to demonstrate the following:
    1) Basic knowledge of basic HTML doc tags (ie. meta, doctype, etc)
    2) Use lists (ordered and unordered)
    3) Linking absolute and relative links and images
    4) Linking back to other parts of the recipe using local links
